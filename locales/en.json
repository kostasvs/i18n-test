Maybe it's time to start looking for other opportunities. By any chance, have you noticed that people, your customers, are looking for something to drink? How about stocking in a fridge or something like that with cans of soda? You can make some extra money on that.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_12" : "There you go, kiddo. Continue listening to your customers and keep improving. Keep improving. And by the way, you know, you don't build an entire empire with just a gift shop, right? I think you should consider opening a new business. That said, you don't want to go rushing into something willy-nilly. You got to know what people want. There's an app for that. MarketInsider app. See what people are looking for.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_13" : "Now, you know: in business we always research the market before we go into it, okay? Finally, before you start your next business, make sure you find a building with a high traffic index. Serving high demand products combined with an address seeing a lot of foot traffic means high revenue.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_14" : "You got two businesses now, huh? Haha. I think that's what the media calls a serial entrepreneur. Very nice work. I'll let you get back to it and I'll catch up with you later, kid.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_15" : "So did you get a call from the bank? They must be shocked to see what's happening with your account on the way it's growing. You should find yourself a nicer apartment and buy yourself some really nice furniture. You deserve it.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_16" : "Hey, kid. I talked with a good friend yesterday. Name is Gary. He owns a drive in wholesale store down in the industrial area. They sell stuff in big chunks, but a lot cheaper. You should bring a car. It's too far to walk.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_17" : "Beautiful! Make sure to keep popularity high for all your businesses. Sometimes you might have to increase your marketing budget to gain the same results. The market changes every day.<br><br>I'm going to visit my vacation residence in Costa Del Sol. When I get back, I hope to see you have increased your daily income. It's time to take your empire to the next level, but we need more money first!",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_18" : "Hey, kid, you got to come see my new villa in Marbella. We'll drink some sangria together some day. It's amazing. Anyways, I'm glad to see you've figured out how to increase your profit. Our next move is all about cutting out the middleman, the wholesaler. We got to start importing our products ourselves.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_19" : "Congratulations on your new headquarters! This is where the top employees of your organization will be seated. First, we have to start hiring. We need a Purchasing Agent to help us secure some import contracts.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_20" : "Ahh, progress! Your first operational employee working from your brand new headquarters. Starting to sound pretty fancy, huh? Now we need to get your purchasing agent working. But first, we need a place to store all your imported products.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_21" : "This is excellent. We'll use this warehouse to store your products until we can get them into your stores. We'll get back to that later. But now let's start stocking up these beautiful new shelves.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_22" : "So your warehouse is just jammed with products. We're at the last part, getting that stuff out of your warehouse and into your stores. So let's get busy.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_23" : "You're doing great, kid. I am very impressed. In fact, I think I should back off a little bit, give you more space so you can continue building up your retail empire on your own.",
